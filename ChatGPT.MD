What is an OOP

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes for organizing code. The fundamental idea behind OOP is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a software system. It provides a way to structure code by organizing data and behavior into reusable and modular units called objects.

Here are some key concepts in OOP:

    Class: A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.

    Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class blueprint, with specific values for its attributes.

    Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, i.e., a class. It helps in hiding the internal details of the object and exposing only what is necessary.

    Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass/base class). This promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

    Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. This can take the form of method overloading (same method name with different parameters) and method overriding (providing a specific implementation in a subclass).

OOP provides a way to design software in a more modular, flexible, and understandable manner. It is widely used in modern programming languages like Java, C++, Python, and others.
